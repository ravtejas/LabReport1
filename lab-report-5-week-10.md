## Lab Report 5 Week 10

# How I found tests with different result

I did a a manual check by comparing the output of the test with the implementation provided along with my implemtation of markdown parse. In hindsight, this
was a rahter tedious process and I would have perhaps tried to use a loop to compare each test files output to my output and then gotten the file number
of the test cases that differed.

# Link to Test files used

I used test files 14 and 22. The links are below.
