# Lab Report 3 (Week 6)

## 1. Streamlining ssh Configuration

- Editing the .ssh/config file

![ssh-config](/ssh-config.png)

This file shows the ssh-config file being edited to allow for easier ssh-ing int the ieng6 server. The alias chosen to replace the previous long command is
**ieng6**. It is now possible to ssh into the server by simply writing ssh ieng6 as shown below.

- Logging in with ssh using new alias

![ssh-alias](/ssh-with-alias.png)

Hence it is now possible to ssh into the server without having to type the long command previously required. This makes the process far less tedious.

- scp command using the new Alias

![scp-alias](/copyingfile-alias.png)

We can also scp files to the serveer by using the alias, as shown above. This also makes the process far easier and less tedious.

## 2. Setting up Github Access with ieng6

- Public key location on github and ieng6 account

![publickkeyieng6](/publickeyieng6.png)

The public key and private key was generated by running `ssh-keygen` on the ieng6 server. The above pictures show the locations of the public key both on
the server as well as the location where it was copied and saved on github.

- Private key location on ieng6 server

![privatekkeyieng6](/privatekey.png)

The above image shows the location of the private key on the ieng6 server.

- Git commands to commit and push changes to a repository

The above image shows changes being added, committed and then pushed to the remote repository on github. Adding the public ssh key to github allowed me to
push chnages to the repository on github, which was previously not possible.

- Link of commit file

The commit changes can be seen in the file below. The file containing the changes can also be found below.

## 3. Copying Whole Directories

- Copying the whole markdown-parser directory using scp -r

![scp-r](/scp-r.png)

Entire directories can be copied using the scp -r command as shown above. The entire markdown-parser directory was copied to the remote ieng6 server using
a single command and it took about 3 seconds to complete.

- Running tests on the server 

![runningTests](/runningtest.png)

Now that the whole directory has been copied to the remote server, we can run test files on the remote server using the files in the directory. The above
image shows tests written in the MarkdownParseTest.java file being run on the remote server.

- Combining scp -r and ssh

![scp-r+ssh](/scp+ssh.png)

We can also combine the scp -r and ssh commands to first, copy the whole directory to the server, and then second, ssh into the server and run the tests
on the server all in one command. The image above shows the command used and the result of the directory being copied to the remote server and then the
tests being run. Overall it took about 5 seconds for the whole command to complete.
