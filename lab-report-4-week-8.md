- Editing the .ssh/config file

![ssh-config](/ssh-config.png)

This file shows the ssh-config file being edited to allow for easier ssh-ing int the ieng6 server. The alias chosen to replace the previous long command is
**ieng6**. It is now possible to ssh into the server by simply writing ssh ieng6 as shown below.

- Logging in with ssh using new alias

![ssh-alias](/ssh-with-alias.png)

Hence it is now possible to ssh into the server without having to type the long command previously required. This makes the process far less tedious.

- scp command using the new Alias

![scp-alias](/copyingfile-alias.png)

We can also scp files to the serveer by using the alias, as shown above. This also makes the process far easier and less tedious.
