# Lab Report 3 (Week 6)

## Streamlining ssh Configuration

- Editing the .ssh/config file

![ssh-config](/ssh-config.png)

This file shows the ssh-config file being edited to allow for easier ssh-ing int the ieng6 server. The alias chosen to replace the previous long command is
**ieng6**. It is now possible to ssh into the server by simply writing ssh ieng6 as shown below.

- Logging in with ssh using new alias

Hence it is now possible to ssh into the server without having to type the long command previously required. This makes the process far less tedious.

- scp command using the new Alias
