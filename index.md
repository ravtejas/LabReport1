# Tutorial for CSE 15L Students

## 1. Installing VS Code

**VS code** is an IDE that we can use to write and execute code on. It can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for all operating systems

## 2. Remotely Connecting

Connecting to a remote computer is done using the ssh command. The course specific account for you that you are going to ssh into can be found [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). After find ing your account use the following command on your terminal to ssh into that remote computer:

`ssh *youraccount*@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

This should prompt you to enter your password and upon correctly entering it you should have access to the remote device.

## 3. Trying Some Commands

Now that you have access to the remote device you can try running some commands on it. Some examples would be:

`ls` - list out elements that are inside the directory your in
`cd _dirname_` - enter a directory
`mkdir _dirname_` - create a new directory
`touch _filename_` - create a new file
